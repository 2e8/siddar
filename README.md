## About

siddar (SImple DeDuplicating ARchiver) - is a shell command that creates incremental backups. Identical files are archived only once, regardless of the file name and location.

File size and sha256 checksum are used to check if files are identical or not.

The tool is crossplatform and requires Python3 with standard libraries only.
